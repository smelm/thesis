- there needs to be default behaviors especially since many dialects diverge in their character classes
- as wide as possible? 
- example: end of line should match anything even unicode line terminators
- this would make the output less readable `[\087\132]` instead of `\n\r`
- would make output more correct
- need to define set differences within DSL
